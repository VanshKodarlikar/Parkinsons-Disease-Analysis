# Parkinsons-Disease-Analysis
Description
This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease through voice measurements using an SVM model. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing data. We performed exploratory data analysis with countplot, heatmap, barplot, and histplot. The SVM model achieved perfect accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
