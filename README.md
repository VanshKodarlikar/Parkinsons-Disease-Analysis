# Parkinsons-Disease-Analysis
This project detects Parkinson's disease using voice measurements with an SVM model. After preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing data, we visualized it using countplot, heatmap, barplot, and histplot. The SVM model achieved perfect metrics. Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
